- SQLite is used as a development database just to do it fast. In a real-world situation I'd use a real DB server.
- I added some tables, fields and indices to the database, but this is for illustration only, and far away from a real DB design. But it's no-nonsense anyway. 
- ORM is not used as we are essentially working only with barcode field for this problem.
